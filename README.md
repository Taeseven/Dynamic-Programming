## Diffing with Costs
-----------------------------
The goal is to align two string, $s$ and $t$, in a way to produce *minimum-cost* alignment. To produce such alignment, we insert the special character '-' some number of times into each string to produce **align_s** and **align_t** so that:  
> * **align_s** and **align_t** have the same length
> * There is no $i$ such that $align\_s[i]$ and $align\_t[i]$ are both '-'.

The cost of an alignment is given by a cost function, which we call **cost**. The cost of an alignment is the sum over all $i$ of $cost(align\_s[i], align_t[i])$. The cost of aligning a letter with itself is always 0.  

This problem arises, for example, in DNA sequencing; given two strands of DNA, there are many sequences of mutations (insertions, deletions, etc.) which would have transformed one to the other; we would like to find the most probable. We know that certain mutations are more likely than otherï¼Œ and these probabilities are reflected in the cost table(the pair with higher likelihood has a lower cost).


## Respacing
-----------------------------
The respacing problem is to put spaces back into a string that has lost them, given a dictionary. For example, given the string "itwasthebestoftimes" and an English dictionary, we would like to
reconstruct the original sentence: "it was the best of times".
